    <description>Determines the Show ID (LMS) even on E&amp;E Opportunities by going through the linked Show Occurrence. Updated for Housing opportunities to pull Show ID of related Tradeshow Show Occurrence. Housing opportunities also have some Stage Name&#39;s that are less than 4 characters in length, so that logic is being revised to use record type name instead for Housing only.</description>
